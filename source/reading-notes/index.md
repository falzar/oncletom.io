I use _books_ as **resources for personal development**. This space is an attempt to share my _margin notes_ to learn as well, and also to have a sneak peak at great books without having to read them entirely.

At the moment, my focus is on **data + privacy**, **education** and **creativity development**. _Poke me_ with your recommendations.
